## Credit

- [single-spa](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa) for community raised a hot wave of micro front-end solutions, and we refer to the implementation of the bridge part in [single-spa](https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa) and we think it is a good design, so we fork the code of the bridge implementation part and make some adjustments for the lifecycles in Garfish.
